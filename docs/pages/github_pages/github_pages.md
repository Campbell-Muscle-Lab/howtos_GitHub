# GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is an incredibly handy tool that allows you to host websites directly from your GitHub repositories. This allows for you to keep your software documentation and instruction manuals directly with the source code, all version controlled.

To learn more about GitHub Pages, see the video below.

## Building Your Website Locally

To accelerate the development of your GitHub Pages website, it is recommended to install the dependencies necessary to build the site locally (on your machine) and not rely on GitHub to build the website for you during the prototyping phase as it can be a lengthy process. We have included a guide on how to do this [at this link](building_locally/building_locally.md)
