# GitHub Repos

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is software for tracking and synchronizing files. It is very powerful but also quite complicated.

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is software that makes it easier to use Git. In our lab, we use:
+ the main website
+ the [desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/)

## Getting started

Git and GitHub can be quite complicated at first although many [help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github) are available. 

To get started using GitHub in the Campbell lab
+ sign up for a GitHub user account
+ [email Ken](mailto:k.s.campbell@uky.edu) and let him know the details
  + Ken will add you to the lab's organization on GitHub

You can then
+ start your own GitHub repo
+ clone an existing project
